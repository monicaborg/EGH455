# 🛠️ EGH455 Advanced Systems Design (Semester 2, 2025)

> _“From concept to prototype — engineering real-world systems through collaboration and iteration.”_

This repository contains artefacts, notes, and collaborative project material for **EGH455 – Advanced Systems Design** at QUT.  
The unit focuses on applying systems engineering methodologies to design, test, and validate complex, team-based engineering solutions.

---

## 📘 Unit Overview

**Coordinator:** Felipe Gonzalez  
**Focus:** Experimental design, teamwork, systems engineering

EGH455 simulates professional engineering environments by guiding teams through the complete systems engineering lifecycle — from identifying a need, to design, verification, and industry-style review.

## 🎯 Learning Outcomes

- Apply **systems engineering thinking** and methodologies to build and test prototype systems
- Meet **customer and regulatory requirements** using international standards
- Decompose complex problems into a **Work Breakdown Structure**
- Communicate specialised concepts to **clients and peers**
- Operate as an effective, collaborative **engineering team member**
